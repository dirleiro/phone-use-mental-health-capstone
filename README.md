# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Social Media Usage vs Emotional Well-Being
Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)
# Introduction
For the past couple of months, I have been attending and studying for the Google Data Analytics certificate offered on Coursera. A total of 8 courses where I enchanced my knowledge on the six stages of the data analysis process (**ask,prepare,process,analyze,share,act**), technical tools (**Excel,SQL,Tableau,R**) and how to use each one of them depending on the circumstances. At the end of the course, it is recommended by Google to create a Capstone Project to practice and use the knowledge achieved on a real-life scenario. There are 2 different paths to take. Path A involved using 2 different datasets with specific tasks,provided by Google. Path B involved researching and finding a dataset that matched the student's interests. I decided to walk down Path B and I have completed my Capstone Project on the **Social Media Usage vs Emotional Well-Being Case Study**.
