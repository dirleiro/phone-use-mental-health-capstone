# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Social Media Usage vs Emotional Well-Being
Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)
# Introduction
For the past couple of months, I have been attending and studying for the Google Data Analytics certificate offered on Coursera. A total of 8 courses where I enchanced my knowledge on the six stages of the data analysis process (**ask,prepare,process,analyze,share,act**), technical tools (**Excel,SQL,Tableau,R**) and how to use each one of them depending on the circumstances. At the end of the course, it is recommended by Google to create a Capstone Project to practice and use the knowledge achieved on a real-life scenario. There are 2 different paths to take. Path A involved using 2 different datasets with specific tasks,provided by Google. Path B involved researching and finding a dataset that matched the student's interests. I decided to walk down Path B and I have completed my Capstone Project on the **Social Media Usage vs Emotional Well-Being Case Study**.
# Background
In today’s hyper-connected world, social media has become an inescapable part of daily life. As of 2025, billions of people scroll, post, and engage online, with platforms like Instagram, X, and LinkedIn shaping how we communicate, work, and feel. Yet, this digital immersion comes with a cost. Research increasingly links excessive social media use to shifts in mental health—sometimes boosting happiness through connection, other times fueling anxiety, sadness, or boredom through comparison and overload. Understanding these patterns is more urgent than ever as usage times climb, particularly among younger adults navigating a post-pandemic, screen-saturated reality.

I am a data analyst at MindSpace, a fictional mental health campaign company dedicated to raising awareness about social media’s impact on emotional well-being. Our mission is to empower individuals with insights to balance their digital habits. I chose this topic for my Path B capstone because I’ve seen firsthand how scrolling can shift my mood, and I’ll be analyzing a dataset of 1,000 users habits and emotions across different platforms to uncover broader trends.
