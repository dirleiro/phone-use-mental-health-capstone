# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Social Media Usage vs Emotional Well-Being
Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)
# Introduction
For the past couple of months, I have been attending and studying for the Google Data Analytics certificate offered on Coursera. A total of 8 courses where I enchanced my knowledge on the six stages of the data analysis process (**ask,prepare,process,analyze,share,act**), technical tools (**Excel,SQL,Tableau,R**) and how to use each one of them depending on the circumstances. At the end of the course, it is recommended by Google to create a Capstone Project to practice and use the knowledge achieved on a real-life scenario. There are 2 different paths to take. Path A involved using 2 different datasets with specific tasks,provided by Google. Path B involved researching and finding a dataset that matched the student's interests. I decided to walk down Path B and I have completed my Capstone Project on the **Social Media Usage vs Emotional Well-Being Case Study**.
# Background
In today’s hyper-connected world, social media has become an inescapable part of daily life. As of 2025, billions of people scroll, post, and engage online, with platforms like Instagram, X, and LinkedIn shaping how we communicate, work, and feel. Yet, this digital immersion comes with a cost. Research increasingly links excessive social media use to shifts in mental health—sometimes boosting happiness through connection, other times fueling anxiety, sadness, or boredom through comparison and overload. Understanding these patterns is more urgent than ever as usage times climb, particularly among younger adults navigating a post-pandemic, screen-saturated reality.

I am a data analyst working with MindSpace, a fictional mental health campaign company dedicated to raising awareness about the impact of social media on emotional well-being. Our mission is to empower individuals with insights to balance their digital habits. 
# Stage 1: Ask
The business task set by our company is to investigate how social media usage influences users emotional well-being while identifying patterns than can promote healthier digital habits.

The stakeholders involved are part of the MindSpace company, external mental health professionals, individuals seeking insights on their digital habits as well as social media platform representatives.

The objectives include:

* Analyzing the relationship between social media usage patterns and dominant emotions to establish clear connections.  
* Identifying specific platforms or behaviors linked to positive or negative emotional outcomes, pinpointing areas of opportunity or concern.  
* Providing actionable recommendations for promoting healthier digital habits, based on the analysis, to improve users emotional well-being and support MindSpace’s goals.
